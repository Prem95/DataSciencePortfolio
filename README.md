 - Repository containing portfolio of Data Science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Python file .py and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). 

### Prerequisites

- What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 3, TensorFlow 1.1, NumPy, Pandas
```
### [Recommendation System using CF](https://github.com/Prem95/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/master/Recommendation_Systems_Colab.ipynb)

 - The project above touches on the basics of building a recomendation model. From the MovieLens dataset, we perform extensive data processing, data analysis, handle imbalaced data, imputation and finally use Collaborative Filtering to do the prediction. 

```
Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
```

### [Recommendation System using Neural Network](https://github.com/Prem95/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/master/Recommendation_Systems_Colab_using_Neural_Network.ipynb)

 - The project above touches on the basics of building a recomendation model. Similar to above, the prediction model is done my using a single-pass Neural Network using a Softmax model to output the probability distribution.

### [Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/classifying-fraudulent-credit-card-transactions-bf3f85660fe0)

 - Creating a prediction model using Machine Learning to detect if any particular transaction is fradulent or not.


### Deployment

 - All the files above can be run using Google Colab with GPU runtime. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
